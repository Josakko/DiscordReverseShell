 4. Go to [discord](https://discord.com/channels/@me), and create new server. Now `Right click` on that server and click on `Copy ID` (if you don't see that option navigate to `user settings` then `Advanced` and enable `Developer Mode`, now you can try to copy Id again).

5. Run `Builder.exe` that you downloaded in first step and make sure that you have `main.py`, `modules` folder etc. in `src` folder relative to the `Builder.exe`
